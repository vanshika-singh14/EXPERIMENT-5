# EXPERIMENT-5
# AIM:
The purpose of the provided C++ code is to illustrate the implementation of conditional statements, including if-else ladder, nested if, and switch-case, within a programming context.
# THEORY:
An if-else ladder comprises a series of if statements designed to execute distinct code blocks based on multiple conditions, thereby facilitating the selection of a specific code block from several options using boolean expressions.
Nested-if statements are utilized to further assess conditions within an existing if-or-else block.
The switch-case statement enables the execution of code blocks based on the value of a variable, serving as an efficient alternative to employing multiple if-else statements.
# CONCLUSION: 
We learnt about conditional statements and their use case.
